## Publishing or Updating the Package on npm

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have an npm account. If not, [create one](https://www.npmjs.com/signup).
- Make sure you are an owner or maintainer of the `aisolutions-react-components` package on npm.
- Confirm you have Node.js and npm installed.

### Steps to Publish a New Version

1. **Update Version Number**:  
   Open `package.json` and update the `version` field according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). For example, if you're making a minor update, increment the minor version:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "aisolutions-react-components",
     "version": "1.1.0",
     ...
   }
   ```

2. **Build the Package**:  
   Before publishing, ensure the package is properly built and all tests pass:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

3. **Login to npm** (if not already logged in):

   ```bash
   npm login
   ```

   Follow the prompts to enter your username, password, and email.

4. **Publish to npm**:
   ```bash
   npm publish --access public
   ```
   This command publishes the current version of the package to npm. The `--access public` flag ensures that the package is publicly accessible.

### Steps to Update an Existing Version

If youâ€™ve previously published the package and want to push a new version (e.g., after adding features, fixing bugs, or making improvements):

1. **Increment the Version**:  
   Update the `version` in `package.json` to the next appropriate version.

2. **Build and Test**:  
   Run the build and tests again to ensure everything is still valid:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Publish the Update**:
   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```

The new version will now be available for installation via npm.
